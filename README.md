# 10th-Assignment-AdvancedTraining

Assignment:

1.  Pick your last code
2.  Make sure to Add CutOut to your code. It should come from your transformations (albumentations)
3.  Use this repo:  [https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder (Links to an external site.)](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder)
    1.  Move LR Finder code to your modules
    2.  Implement LR Finder (for SGD, not for ADAM)
    3.  Implement ReduceLROnPlatea:  [https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau (Links to an external site.)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau)
4.  Find best LR to train your model
5.  Use SDG with Momentum
6.  Train for 50 Epochs.
7.  Show Training and Test Accuracy curves
8.  Target 88% Accuracy.
9.  Run GradCAM on the any 25 misclassified images. Make sure you mention what is the prediction and what was the ground truth label.
10.  Submit
